You will need to find a way to share the total number of high fives across your controllers. For example: "I've successfully made 4 of the 11 successful high fives!"

You'll be using Angular Routes to make a separate view for 3 different fictional characters of your choice. Your page should have a static header and footer of some kind, and 3 navigation buttons to swap out the content of the characters.

Hard Mode

Use ng-show, ng-hide, ng-if, or ng-animate to add some creative, dynamic elements to your views when users click on things.

Pro Mode

Make the whole experience responsive with the Bootstrap.
